I spent time trying to make regex do something, then followed Jonathan Paulson's solution method

Things I learned about/used:

from collections import defaultdict

defaultdict is a cool dictionary that you can add initalize empty and then add to as you go

interacting with dictionaries is still hard for me.

I also learned about the .join method! This one is pretty cool, it lets you specify a delimiter 
and then concatenate the all the contents of a list. How the heck jonathan thought to use that, 
or where else it could be used, is a mystery to me. 

I also loved the simplicity of his split by commands, then setup ifs to handle each command type.
