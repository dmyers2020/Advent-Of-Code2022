# Advent-Of-Code2022
Shooting for day ten. Trying to focus on expanding my knowledge instead of beating my head against the wall


I will try to add a readme to each day sumarizing the things I learned or practiced that day, and Whenever I decide to call it for this year, I'll consolidate all that here.
